1) Elastic Load Balancing :

Elastic Load Balancing is the AWS service that automatically distributes incoming application 
traffic across multiple resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances. 

* A load balancer acts as a single point of contact for all incoming web traffic to your Auto Scaling group. 
This means that as you add or remove Amazon EC2 instances in response to the amount of incoming traffic, 
these requests route to the load balancer first. Then, the requests spread across multiple resources 
that will handle them. 

* For example, if you have multiple Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing
distributes the workload across the multiple instances so that no single instance has to carry the bulk of it.

a) Low-demand period

Hereâ€™s an example of how Elastic Load Balancing works. Suppose that a few customers have
 come to the coffee shop and are ready to place their orders. 

b) High-demand period

Throughout the day, as the number of customers increases, the coffee shop opens more 
registers to accommodate them. In the diagram, the Auto Scaling group represents this.
