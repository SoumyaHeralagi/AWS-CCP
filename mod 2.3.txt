*Amazon EC2 pricing

With Amazon EC2, we pay only for the compute time that we use. 
Amazon EC2 offers a variety of pricing options for different use cases. 
For example, if our use case can withstand interruptions, we can save with Spot Instances. 
we can also save by committing early and locking in a minimum level of use with Reserved Instances.

*On-Demand Instances 

these are ideal for short-term, irregular workloads that cannot be interrupted. No upfront costs or minimum contracts apply. 
The instances run continuously until you stop them, 
and you pay for only the compute time you use.Sample use cases for On-Demand Instances include 
developing and testing applications and running applications that have unpredictable usage patterns. 
On-Demand Instances are not recommended for workloads that last a year or longer because these workloads 
can experience greater cost savings using Reserved Instances.

*Reserved Instances 

these are a billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. 
we can purchase Standard Reserved and Convertible Reserved Instances for a 1-year or 3-year term, and 
Scheduled Reserved Instances for a 1-year term. You realize greater cost savings with the 3-year option.
At the end of a Reserved Instance term, you can continue using the Amazon EC2 instance without interruption. 
However, you are charged On-Demand rates until you do one of the following:
Terminate the instance.
Purchase a new Reserved Instance that matches the instance attributes (instance type, Region, tenancy, and platform).

*Scalability

Scalability involves beginning with only the resources we need and designing your architecture to 
automatically respond to changing demand by scaling out or in. As a result, we pay for only the resources we use. 
we don’t have to worry about a lack of computing capacity to meet our customers’ needs.
