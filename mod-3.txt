-> Selecting a Region:

* When determining the right Region for your services, data, and applications, 
consider the following four business factors:

1) Compliance with data governance and legal requirements:

* Depending on your company and location, you might need to run your data out of specific areas. 
For example, if your company requires all of its data to reside within the boundaries of the UK, 
you would choose the London Region. 

* Not all companies have location-specific data regulations, so you might need to focus 
more on the other three factors. 

2) Proximity to your customers:

* Selecting a Region that is close to your customers will help you to get content to
 them faster. For example, your company is based in Washington, DC, and many of your 
customers live in Singapore. 

* You might consider running your infrastructure in the Northern Virginia Region
 to be close to company headquarters, and run your applications from the Singapore Region.

3) Available services within a Region:
* Sometimes, the closest Region might not have all the features that you want to offer to customers. 

* AWS is frequently innovating by creating new services and expanding on features within 
existing services. 
* However, making new services available around the world sometimes requires AWS to build out physical 
hardware one Region at a time. 

4) Pricing:

* Suppose that you are considering running applications in both the United States and Brazil. 
The way Brazil’s tax structure is set up, it might cost 50% more to run the same workload out of 
the São Paulo Region compared to the Oregon Region. You will learn in more detail that several 
factors determine pricing, but for now know that the cost of services can vary from Region to Region.

-> Availability Zone:
is a single data center or a group of data centers within a Region. 

* Availability Zones are located tens of miles apart from each other. This is close enough to 
have low latency (the time between when content requested and received) between Availability Zones. 

* However, if a disaster occurs in one part of the Region, they are distant enough to reduce the 
chance that multiple Availability Zones are affected.

-> Edge locations:

* An edge location is a site that Amazon CloudFront uses to store cached copies of your 
content closer to your customers for faster delivery.

-> Ways to interact with AWS services:
* The AWS Management Console is a web-based interface for accessing and managing AWS services. 

* You can quickly access recently used services and search for other services by name, keyword, or acronym.

* The console includes wizards and automated workflows that can simplify the process of completing tasks.

-> AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) :

* AWS CLI enables you to control multiple AWS services directly from the command line within one tool.
 AWS CLI is available for users on Windows, macOS, and Linux. 

-> AWS CloudFormation

* With AWS CloudFormation, you can treat your infrastructure as code. 

* This means that you can build an environment by writing lines of code instead of using the AWS Management 
Console to individually provision resources.

* AWS CloudFormation provisions your resources in a safe, repeatable manner, enabling you to 
frequently build your infrastructure and applications without having to perform manual actions.
