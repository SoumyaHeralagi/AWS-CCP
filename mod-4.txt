* A networking service that you can use to establish boundaries around your AWS resources is 
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)

-> Amazon VPC:

* enables you to provision an isolated section of the AWS Cloud. 
In this isolated section, you can launch resources in a virtual network that you define. 
Within a virtual private cloud (VPC), you can organize your resources into subnets. 
A subnet is a section of a VPC that can contain resources such as Amazon EC2 instances.

-> An internet gateway:
 is a connection between a VPC and the internet. You can think of an internet gateway as being similar 
to a doorway that customers use to enter the coffee shop. Without an internet gateway,
 no one can access the resources within your VPC.

-> Virtual private gateway:

* To access private resources in a VPC, you can use a virtual private gateway. 

* Hereâ€™s an example of how a virtual private gateway works. You can think of 
the internet as the road between your home and the coffee shop. Suppose that you are 
traveling on this road with a bodyguard to protect you. You are still using the same road
as other customers, but with an extra layer of protection. 

-> AWS Direct Connect :
* is a service that enables you to establish a dedicated 
private connection between your data center and a VPC.  

-> Subnets and network access control lists:
* A subnet is a section of a VPC in which you can group resources based on security or operational needs. 
Subnets can be public or private. 

-> Network traffic in a VPC:

* When a customer requests data from an application hosted in the AWS Cloud, this request is 
sent as a packet. A packet is a unit of data sent over the internet or a network. 

* It enters into a VPC through an internet gateway. Before a packet can enter into a 
subnet or exit from a subnet, it checks for permissions. These permissions indicate who 
sent the packet and how the packet is trying to communicate with the resources in a subnet.

-> Network access control lists (ACLs)

* A network access control list (ACL) is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound 
traffic at the subnet level.

-> Stateless packet filtering:

* Network ACLs perform stateless packet filtering.

* They remember nothing and check packets that cross the subnet border each way: inbound and outbound. 

* When a packet response for that request comes back to the subnet, the network ACL does not remember your 
previous request. The network ACL checks the packet response against its list of rules to determine
 whether to allow or deny.

-> Security groups:

* A security group is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic for an Amazon EC2 instance.

-> Stateful packet filtering:

* Security groups perform stateful packet filtering. They remember previous decisions made for incoming packets.

->Domain Name System (DNS):

* Suppose that AnyCompany has a website hosted in the AWS Cloud.
 
* Customers enter the web address into their browser, and they are able to access the website. 
This happens because of Domain Name System (DNS) resolution. 

* DNS resolution involves a customer DNS resolver communicating with a company DNS server.

-> Amazon Route S3: 
* is a DNS web service. It gives developers and businesses a reliable way to route end users 
to internet applications hosted in AWS. 

* Amazon Route 53 connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWS 
(such as Amazon EC2 instances and load balancers). It can route users to infrastructure outside of AWS.
