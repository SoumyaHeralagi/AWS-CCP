-> Amazon EFS:

* File storage: In file storage, multiple clients (such as users, applications, servers, and so on) 
can access data that is stored in shared file folders. In this approach, a storage server 
uses block storage with a local file system to organize files. Clients access data through file paths.

-> Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS):
* is a scalable file system used with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources.
* As you add and remove files, Amazon EFS grows and shrinks automatically.
* It can scale on demand to petabytes without disrupting applications. 

->Amazon RDS:
* In a relational database, data is stored in a way that relates it to other pieces of data. 

* Relational databases use structured query language (SQL) to store and query data. 

* This approach allows data to be stored in an easily understandable, consistent, and scalable way.
 For example, the coffee shop owners can write a SQL query to identify all the customers
 whose most frequently purchased drink is a medium latte.

-> Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS):
* is a service that enables you to run relational databases in the AWS Cloud.

* Amazon RDS is a managed service that automates tasks such as hardware provisioning, 
database setup, patching, and backups. With these capabilities, you can spend less time
 completing administrative tasks and more time using data to innovate your applications.

-> Amazon RDS database engines:

* Amazon RDS is available on six database engines, which optimize for memory, performance, or input/output (I/O).

* Supported database engines include:

          Amazon Aurora
          PostgreSQL
          MySQL
          MariaDB
          Oracle Database
          Microsoft SQL Server

-> Amazon Aurora :
* is an enterprise-class relational database. 

* It is compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL relational databases. 

* It is up to five times faster than standard MySQL databases and up to three times faster than 
standard PostgreSQL databases.

-> Amazon DynamoDB:
* Nonrelational databases:

* In a nonrelational database, you create tables. A table is a place where you can store and query data.

* Nonrelational databases are sometimes referred to as “NoSQL databases” because they use 
structures other than rows and columns to organize data. One type of structural approach 
for nonrelational databases is key-value pairs.
