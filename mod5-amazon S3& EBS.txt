-> instance store: 
* provides temporary block-level storage for an Amazon EC2 instance. 

* An instance store is disk storage that is physically attached to the host computer for an 
EC2 instance, and therefore has the same lifespan as the instance. When the instance is terminated, 
you lose any data in the instance store.

-> Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS):
* is a service that provides block-level storage volumes that you can use with
 Amazon EC2 instances. If you stop or terminate an Amazon EC2 instance, all the data on the
 attached EBS volume remains available.

-> An EBS snapshot : 
* is an incremental backup. This means that the first backup taken of a volume
 copies all the data. For subsequent backups, only the blocks of data that have changed since 
the most recent snapshot are saved. 

-> In object storage:
* each object consists of data, metadata, and a key.

-> Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3):
* is a service that provides object-level storage. Amazon S3 stores data as objects in buckets.

* You can upload any type of file to Amazon S3, such as images, videos, text files, and so on. 
For example, you might use Amazon S3 to store backup files, media files for a website, or 
archived documents. Amazon S3 offers unlimited storage space. The maximum file size for an 
object in Amazon S3 is 5 TB.

-> Amazon S3 storage classes:

* With Amazon S3, you pay only for what you use. You can choose from a range of storage classes to 
select a fit for your business and cost needs. When selecting an Amazon S3 storage class, 

consider these two factors:
* How often you plan to retrieve your data
* How available you need your data to be

-> S3 Standard:

* Designed for frequently accessed data
* Stores data in a minimum of three Availability Zones

-> S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA):

* Ideal for infrequently accessed data
* Similar to S3 Standard but has a lower storage price and higher retrieval price

->S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA):

* Stores data in a single Availability Zone
* Has a lower storage price than S3 Standard-IA

->S3 Intelligent-Tiering:

* Ideal for data with unknown or changing access patterns
* Requires a small monthly monitoring and automation fee per object
